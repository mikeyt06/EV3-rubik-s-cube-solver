# EV3 Rubik's Cube Solver

This project is a Rubik's Cube solving robot built using the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms platform and programmed in Python with the ev3dev operating system.

The robot scans all six faces of a Rubik’s Cube using a color sensor, calculates a solution using a solving algorithm, and then uses its motors to perform the moves needed to solve the cube.

## Platforms and Tools

- Python 3
- LEGO EV3 hardware
- ev3dev (Linux-based OS for the EV3)
- EV3 color sensor and motors
